Welcome to **CodeWire**, a visual scripting tool inspired by Unreal Engine 4's Blueprints. It is designed to help users visualize code and automate repetitive tasks efficiently. CodeWire is language-agnostic, meaning multiple programming languages can be supported as target outputs in future updates. 

Thanks @L-o-o-t for Logo and Discord Server.

## Getting Started
To start using CodeWire, open the application, right-click on the canvas, and start adding nodes. CodeWire provides a visual flow for writing scripts, allowing for faster prototyping of ideas.

## Features
- üöÄ **Node-Based Editor** for visual scripting
- üåê **Multi-Language Support** (Currently supports JavaScript)
- üé® **Intuitive User Interface** for better visualization and faster coding
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Nodes** creation for extended functionality

## Basic Workflow
1. **Add a Node**: Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select "Begin" to start your node chain.
2. **Connect Nodes**: After adding the "Begin" node, continue adding nodes such as Print, Variables, etc., by right-clicking and selecting from the context menu.
3. **Pan & Zoom**: Use the middle mouse button to pan across the canvas. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
4. **Connect Wires**: 
   - **White Wires**: These control the flow of execution between nodes.
   - **Colored Wires**: These handle data inputs and outputs between nodes.
5. **Delete Nodes or Wires**: Hold `Ctrl` and click a node or wire to delete it, or right-click and select "Delete."

## Nodes and Connections
Nodes are the building blocks in CodeWire that perform actions. They are connected by wires that represent the flow of execution and data.

- **Execution Flow**: Nodes use white wires to control the script's sequence.
- **Data Flow**: Colored wires represent the input/output of data between nodes. The color indicates the data type being transferred.

## Creating Variables
Variables can be created using the left-hand panel:
1. Click "New Variable" on the left panel to create a new variable.
2. The variable will be available in the right-click context menu or can be dragged from the panel onto the canvas.

### Connecting Variables
- Variables are used to pass data between nodes. Simply drag the variable to the desired node or select it from the context menu.

## Node Anatomy
Each node has specific attributes depending on its type. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Title**: Displays the node's name (e.g., "Print").
2. **Execution Pins**: White triangle pins to control the flow of execution.
   - **Input Execution Pin**: Marks the start of a node‚Äôs execution.
   - **Output Execution Pin**: Marks the next step in the flow.
3. **Input Pins**: Colored pins that receive data into the node.
4. **Output Pins**: Colored pins that output data from the node.
5. **Actions**: Nodes like Print or Add perform specific operations.

For example, a **Print Node** would have:
- Input: A single pin for the value to print.
- Output: A white execution pin to control the next step.

### Example: Fibonacci Series Node
To generate a Fibonacci series, you can chain nodes that loop through calculations, each connected to the next using data pins (colored) and execution flow pins (white).

## Executing Code
Once your nodes are connected and ready, you can generate native JavaScript code by clicking on the **Code** button. This transforms the visual representation into a runnable script.

## Adding New Nodes
To extend CodeWire by adding new JavaScript nodes, follow these steps:

1. **Define Node**: Add the node‚Äôs description in the `javascript/Nodes/nodes.js` file.
    ```js
    if (type == 'Print') {
        nodeDescription.nodeTitle = 'Print';
        nodeDescription.execIn = true;
        nodeDescription.execOut = { execOut0: { outOrder: 0 }};
        nodeDescription.inputs = { input0: { inputTitle: 'Value', dataType: 'Data' }};
        nodeDescription.color = 'Print';
    }
    ```

2. **Add to Context Menu**: In `index.html`, include the node in the right-click context menu.
    ```html
    <div class="context-menu-items">Print</div>
    ```

3. **Define Code Generation**: In `VisualScriptToJavascript.js`, add the logic to convert the node‚Äôs operation into JavaScript code.
    ```js
    case "Print": {
        this.script += `console.log(${this.handleInp(inputPins[0])});\n`;
        this.coreAlgorithm(execOutPins[0]);
    }
    ```

### Example: Adding a Print Node
By following these steps, you'll add a new "Print" node that outputs console logs when executed in JavaScript.
